This project is to show the model creation to predict the patient to either survive or die 
after hospitalized because of Covid19

To make the visualization portion work, a matched pair of matplotlib and python is important regarding their versions
Python-3.9.0-amd64.exe, matplotlib-3.4.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl are included in this package for convenience 
if you are using wondows 10+
